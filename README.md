# Overview

The front end of the portfolio was made entirely with plain JavaScript code using ECMAScript 2015+ features without any frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. It's using libraries such as [GSAP](https://greensock.com/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [ogl](https://github.com/oframe/ogl). To generate our static files that will be uploaded to the environment, we're using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).
